## Description

### Our Story

In the bustling world of college life, where students juggle demanding coursework, intense finals, and part-time jobs, we have experienced firsthand the overwhelming stress that comes with planning trips on top of existing responsibilities. Driven by our own experiences and a desire to alleviate the burden, we embarked on a mission to create a travel application aiming to simplify the trip planning process and offer a much-needed respite from the additional stressors that come with life 

### Features

Journey Journal is the number one site for all your vacation needs! When visiting our page users are greated by the homepage that can take them to an about page, sign-up page, login page as well as back to home. Users can go to our site and create an account. Afterwards, users are able to login in and start planning their vacations. Through the use of our hotels page users are able to search for local hotels using a zip code. These locations display the hotels name as well as their address. On the vactaion page users are able to plan their vacation adding it to a list of all their created vacations.
